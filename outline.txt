Modelling and Optimisation with Graphs

Application case studies
------------------------

Kidney Exchange

Network epidemiology (diseased cows).

Computational Algebra

Optimality: either morally, financially, or proofily.

High level modelling
--------------------

Expressivity

Compilation

Multiple encodings. Some not obvious, e.g. kidney exchange

Low level support
-----------------

Subgraph algorithms often have a constraint-based feel to them, but use different data structures.

Bounding is quite different.

Propagation inside subgraph algorithms, e.g. connectivity.

Sharing nogoods, modulo theories.

High level to glue all this together.
